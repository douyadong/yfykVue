history，默认为hash，就是路由中域名和后面部分用#隔开，如：http://localhost:8080/#/agent，如果改成history模式，这个路由风格就变成了：\n    http://localhost:8080/agent，但是这种模式需要对nginx | apache等appserver进行配置：\n    Nginx 的站点设置增加：\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html ;\n    }\n    Apache的站点设置增加：\n    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n        RewriteEngine On\n        RewriteBase /\n        RewriteRule ^index\\.html$ - [L]\n
